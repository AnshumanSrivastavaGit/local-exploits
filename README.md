## CVE-2017-5899

S-nail local root exploit.

Wrapper for @wapiflapi's s-nail-privget.c local root [exploit](https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/01/27/7/1) (2017-01-27) for [CVE-2017-5899](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5899).

> Directory traversal vulnerability in the setuid root helper binary in S-nail (later S-mailx) before 14.8.16 allows local users to write to arbitrary files and consequently gain root privileges via a .. (dot dot) in the randstr argument.


## CVE-2017-4915

VMWare Workstation / Player local root exploit.

Based on Jann Horn's [PoC](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1142) (2017-05-21) for [CVE-2017-4915](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-4915).

> VMware Workstation Pro/Player contains an insecure library loading vulnerability via ALSA sound driver configuration files. Successful exploitation of this issue may allow unprivileged host users to escalate their privileges to root in a Linux host machine.


## CVE-2011-2921

ktsuss <= 1.4 setuid local root exploit.

Wrapper for John Lightsey's [PoC](https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/08/13/2) (2011-08-13) for [CVE-2011-2921](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2011-2921).

Independently rediscovered CVE-2011-2921 while auditing SparkyLinux.

> The `ktsuss` executable is setuid `root` and does not drop
> privileges prior to executing user specified commands,
> resulting in command execution with `root` privileges.
>
> SparkyLinux 2019.08 and prior package a vulnerable version of `ktsuss` installed by default.


## antix-mxlinux-sudo-persist-config-lpe

antiX / MX Linux default sudo configuration `persist-config` local root exploit.

> antiX / MX Linux default `sudo` configuration permits users in the `users` group
> to execute `/usr/local/bin/persist-config` as root without providing a password,
> resulting in trivial privilege escalation.
>
> Execution via `sudo` requires `users` group privileges. By default,
> the first user created on the system is a member of the `users` group.


## asan-suid-root

Local root exploit for SUID executables compiled with AddressSanitizer (ASan).

Based on 0x27's [exploit](https://gist.github.com/0x27/9ff2c8fb445b6ab9c94e) (2016-02-18) for Szabolcs Nagy's [Address Sanitizer local root PoC](https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q1/363) (2016-02-17).

> Use of ASan configuration related environment variables is not restricted
> when executing setuid executables built with ASan. The `log_path` option
> can be set using the `ASAN_OPTIONS` environment variable, allowing clobbering
> of arbitrary files, with the privileges of the setuid user.


## emmabuntus-sudo-autologin-lightdm-exec-lpe

Emmabuntüs default sudo configuration `autologin_lightdm_exec.sh` local root exploit.

> Emmabuntüs default `sudo` configuration permits any user to execute
> `/usr/bin/autologin_lightdm_exec.sh` as root without providing a password.
>
> The `autologin_lightdm_exec.sh` script calls `cp` with user supplied arguments,
> resulting in trivial privilege escalation.


## lastore-daemon-root

lastore-daemon local root exploit.

Based on King's Way's [exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/39433/) (2016-02-10).

> The lastore-daemon D-Bus configuration on Deepin Linux 15.5 permits any user
> in the sudo group to install arbitrary packages without providing a password,
> resulting in code execution as root. By default, the first user created on
> the system is a member of the sudo group.
